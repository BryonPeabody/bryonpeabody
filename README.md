# Hey there, I’m Bryon 

I'm a backend developer based in Tempe, AZ, focused on building full-stack Django applications with Python, HTML templates, and SQLite.

### Projects
- **[Task Manager](https://github.com/bryonpeabody/task-manager)** – Create, edit, and manage daily tasks (CRUD)
- **[Expense Tracker](https://github.com/bryonpeabody/expense-tracker)** – Log and categorize personal expenses

You can view these projects (and more as I continue building) in my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/bryonpeabody).

### In Progress
Currently working on an **advanced Django project** that includes API integration, authentication, and testing.
